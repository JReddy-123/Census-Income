# Census-Income
Predicting whether an individualâ€™s income exceeds $50,000 annually based on demographic and employment data is a significant challenge in binary classification. This project utilizes the "Adult Income" dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Kohavi) to explore the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in solving this problem.
